# Docker Setup for FM4MC

This directory contains files to build and run FM4MC inside a Docker container.

## Contents
- `Dockerfile` – builds FM4MC with Gradle and packages the runtime jars with required test data.
- `run.sh` – entry point inside the container; runs the Configuration Manager, Configuration Creator, or JMH and stores results in `/output`.
- `build_and_run.sh` – Bash helper script that builds the image and runs the container while collecting results.
- `build_and_run.bat` – Windows batch script performing the same build-and-run workflow.

## Usage
Ensure Docker is installed. The helper scripts attempt to start the daemon if it is not already running (Docker Desktop on Windows).
### Linux / macOS

Run the helper script with Bash (on Windows, use Git Bash or WSL). Pass one of `manager`, `creator`, or `jmh` (default) to select the component:

```bash
bash ./Dockersetup/build_and_run.sh manager
```

### Windows

Run the batch script from a Command Prompt or PowerShell window, optionally supplying `manager`, `creator`, or `jmh`:

```bat
Dockersetup\build_and_run.bat creator
```

Results are written to `Dockersetup/output/`:

- `benchmark.csv` – JMH benchmark output
- `graph.graphml` – graph produced by the Configuration Manager
- `configurations.csv` – configurations generated by the Configuration Creator

The following section describes the `benchmark.csv` produced in `jmh` mode.

### Benchmark Output Format
The file uses semicolon-separated columns. A shortened example is shown below:

```
Benchmark;Mode;Cnt;Score;Error;Units
Paper.Online.OnlineBenchmarkRunner;avgt;5;123.456;7.890;ms/op
```

| Column      | Meaning                                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Benchmark` | Fully qualified benchmark name                                           |
| `Mode`      | Measurement type (`avgt` = average time)                                 |
| `Cnt`       | Number of measurement iterations                                         |
| `Score`     | Mean execution time per operation                                        |
| `Error`     | 99.9% confidence interval around the score                               |
| `Units`     | Unit of `Score` and `Error` (typically `ms/op`)                           |

Parameterised benchmarks may append extra columns prefixed with `Param:` for each input.
When comparing different runs, ensure that both the parameters and units match; lower
scores indicate faster execution.
